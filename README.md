The Simple Calculator is a Python-based command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as an excellent beginner project to understand user input handling, conditional statements, functions, and error checking in Python.

This calculator is lightweight, easy to use, and runs in the terminal without any external dependencies. The script guides the user step-by-step, prompting them to enter two numbers and choose an operator. It then computes and displays the result, with built-in error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
